Recently our beloved housemates left us, along with all their amazing furnatures in our livingroom. This triggered a daily 1-2 hr session seaching through Facebook marketplace, and a weekly visit to Home Depot. After a two week search, we have successfuly re-furnished most of our house.

We got 6 chicks, and "re-modeled" a shed to become into a chicken coop. Set up a chicken run.
